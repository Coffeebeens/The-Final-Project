        The process of adopting a cat: <br> <br>

        1. Initial expression of interest: <br> First of all, you need to fill in an expression of interest to show your <br> interest in adopting a cat. This can be done online, via an application form or by visiting the cat <br> cafe in person. In the registration of interest, you may be asked to enter information about yourself, <br>
        your lifestyle, your previous experiences with cats and what you are looking for in a feline companion. <br><br>

        2. Evaluation and matching: <br> After you have submitted your expression of interest, the staff at the cat <br> cafe will evaluate it and assess whether you are a suitable cat owner. They may contact you to ask br
        additional questions or to schedule a personal interview or visit. <br> <br>

        Based on your answers and preferences, they will then try to match you with a suitable cat. They take into <br> account factors such as the cat's personality, energy level, any special needs and how well they <br> think the cat would fit into your home and lifestyle. <br><br>

        3. Personal Meeting and Evaluation: <br> If you have been matched with a cat, the next step will usually be  <br> a personal meeting. You get the opportunity to meet and interact with the cat to see if there is a <br> mutual connection and if the cat seems like a good fit for you and your family. <br> <br>

        The staff can also conduct a home inspection to make sure your home is safe and suitable for a cat. <br> This may mean they check that you have the necessary precautions such as cat-friendly furniture, a safe <br> outdoor environment if applicable and no hazardous substances or areas that could harm the cat. <br>

        4. Approval and Adoption Agreement: <br> If all goes well during the meeting and possible home inspection, <br> you can be approved as an adoptive owner. You will then be asked to sign an adoption agreement and <br> pay any adoption fee. The adoption agreement is a legal document that sets out the terms of  <br>
        the adoption and your responsibilities as a cat owner. <br><br>

        The adoption agreement may include details about providing the cat with veterinary care, raising it in <br> a healthy manner, not abandoning it, and returning it to the cat cafe if you can no longer care for it. <br>

        5. Homecoming and integration: <br> When the adoption agreement is signed and the adoption fee paid, you <br>
        can bring your new companion <br>
